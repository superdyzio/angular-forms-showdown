    <h2>What are Angular Forms?</h2>
    <p>Angular provides two approaches for handling user input through forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Template-driven forms</strong> - Forms where the logic is defined in the template</li>
      <li><strong>Reactive forms</strong> - Forms where the logic is defined in the component</li>
      <li><strong>Signal-based forms</strong> - The new approach using Angular signals</li>
    </ul>
